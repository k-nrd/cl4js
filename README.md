# Commands

When developing locally, these commands can help you out:

### Server

Use the vercel-cli to spin up a dev environment. You can visit your site
at http://localhost:8888. Useful when you want to debug Vercel Functions.

```shell
yarn server
```

### Watch

Watch and recompile your site as you make changes. You can visit your site at http://localhost:8700.
If you use this in tandem with `yarn server`, you can use port 8888 for everything.

```shell
yarn watch
```

### Clean

Removes artifacts that are generated by shadow-cljs and tailwind.

```shell
yarn clean
```

### Build

Builds the site for release. Vercel will use the same command when deploying

```shell
yarn build
```

### REPL

Spins up a shadow-cljs browser REPL

```shell
yarn repl
```
